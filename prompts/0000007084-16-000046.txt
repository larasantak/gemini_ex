The Company does not expect any of its new products to have a significant impact on the Company’s revenues in 2016. Source and Availability of Raw MaterialsSubstantially all of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities.  In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.  The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.7Patents, Trademarks, and LicensesThe Company owns patents, trademarks, and licenses, including approximately $209 million of trademarks from the Wild Flavors acquisition in 2014, but does not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks or licenses. Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant CustomersSince the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.  There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, sugarcane, and other grains. The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements.  Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.  Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.  No material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.  The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.  Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.CompetitionThe Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.  Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio.Research and Development ExpendituresThe Company’s research and development expenditures are focused on responding to demand from customers’ product development or formulation needs, improving processing efficiency, and developing food, feed, fuel, and industrial products from renewable agricultural crops.  Research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, net of reimbursements of government grants, was approximately $122 million, $79 million, and $59 million, respectively.  The increase in 2014 and 2015 is due principally to research and development activities of the recently acquired Wild Flavors. Recent acquisitions have significantly increased the Company’s laboratories and technical centers around the world that greatly enhance the Company’s ability to interact with customers in Europe, Asia, and South America, not only to provide flavors, but also to support the sales of other food ingredients.  In addition, the acquisition of Wild Flavors approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development.  A number of these laboratories are being expanded with new capabilities to enhance the Company’s ability to develop custom solutions for our customers.The Company is working with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory and other key academic and corporate partners on projects to demonstrate carbon capture and sequestration as a viable option for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing operations.  The first project, Illinois Basin Decatur Project, started operations in the first quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and successfully completed injecting 1 million tons of CO2 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.  The second project, the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture & Sequestration, commenced construction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  This second facility obtained the underground injection control permit in November 2014 and is expected to receive authorization to start injection in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.8The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of industrial chemicals with an objective to produce key chemical building blocks that serve as a platform for producing a variety of commodity chemicals.  The key chemical building blocks are derived from the Company’s starch and oilseed-based feedstocks.  Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis.  The chemicals pipeline includes the development of chemicals and intermediates that are currently produced from petrochemical resources as well as new-to-the-market bio-based products. The Company’s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration. In an effort to further advance the development of bio-based chemical technologies, the Company has partnered with the Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis and has added research capabilities at the University of Kansas.Environmental ComplianceDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, $61 million was spent specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.The Company’s business could be affected in the future by national and global regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions.  In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted regulations requiring the owners and operators of certain facilities to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions.  The U.S. EPA has also begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary and mobile sources under the Clean Air Act.  For example, the U.S. EPA has promulgated rules regarding the construction and operation of boilers, which could indirectly affect the Company by limiting the construction of new coal-fired boilers and significantly increasing the complexity and cost of modifying any existing coal-fired boilers.   California is also moving forward with various programs to reduce greenhouse gases.  Globally, a number of countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol have instituted or are considering climate change legislation, regulations, and agreements.  Most notable is the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System.  The Company has several facilities in Europe that participate in this system.  It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements.  Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.Number of EmployeesThe number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately 32,300 at December 31, 2015 and 33,900 at December 31, 2014.  The net decrease in the number of full-time employees is primarily related to the sale of the Company’s cocoa and chocolate businesses partially offset by acquisitions.Financial Information About Foreign and U.S. OperationsItem 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 2, “Properties,” includes information relating to the Company’s foreign and U.S. operations.  Geographic financial information is set forth in Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 herein, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.Available InformationThe Company’s website is http://www.adm.com.  The Company makes available, free of charge, through its website, the Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K; quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; current reports on Form 8-K; Directors and Officers Forms 3, 4, and 5; and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such materials with, or furnishing them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In addition, the Company makes available, through its website, the Company’s Code of Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the written charters of the Audit, Compensation/Succession, Nominating/Corporate Governance, and Executive Committees.References to our website address in this report are provided as a convenience and do not constitute, or should not be viewed as, an incorporation by reference of the information contained on, or available through, the website.  Therefore, such information should not be considered part of this report.9The public may read and copy any materials filed by the Company with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.  The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.  The SEC maintains a website which contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file information electronically with the SEC.  The SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov.The Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance.Management directs a Company-wide Integrated Risk Management (IRM) program, with oversight from the Company’s Board of Directors.  The Company’s Audit Committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis.The risk factors that follow are the main risks that the IRM program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on management-defined risk limits.The Company, through its business unit, functional, and corporate teams, are continually updating, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating these and other business and compliance risks through the IRM program.  The availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises can be affected by weather conditions, disease, government programs, competition, and various other factors beyond the Company’s control and could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  Additionally, the Company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities used by the Company in its operations is maintained.  These factors have historically caused volatility in the availability and prices of agricultural commodities and, consequently, in the Company’s operating results and working capital requirements.  Reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather-related factors or other reasons could adversely affect the Company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Company’s ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner.  For example, a drought in North America in 2012 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased.  High and volatile commodity prices can adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs.  Conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cyles, price volatility is somewhat diminished.  This could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities.10The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates.The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors.  The company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities, workforce, and other materials and supplies.  Additionally, competitors offer similar products and services, as well as alternative products and services, to the Company’s customers.  The Company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins, profits, and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating, working capital, dividend, or capital expenditure needs.  Competition impacts the Company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors.  Pricing of the Company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring on-line idled capacity or to build new production capacity.  Many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities.  The markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution.  Significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products, thereby negatively impacting the competitiveness of the Company’s significant origination, processing, and export footprint, and the Company’s operating results.  In addition, continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry that could impact the relative competitiveness of the Company.  To compete effectively, the Company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market share, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions.  Fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.The Company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices.  The Company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal.  The Company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.  Significant increases in the cost of these items, including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Company’s production costs and operating results.The Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products, or in the case of ethanol, blended into gasoline to increase octane content.  Therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other octane enhancers.  A significant decrease in the price of gasoline, diesel fuel, or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Company’s ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.The Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.The Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. While 54 percent of the Company’s processing plants and 70 percent of its procurement facilities are located in the United States, the Company also has significant operations in both developed areas (such as Western Europe, Canada, Brazil) and emerging market areas (such as Eastern Europe, Asia, portions of South and Central America, the Middle East, and Africa).  One of the Company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas such as Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Company’s products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the Company’s suppliers, customers, and other counterparties.  In addition, emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including, but not limited to, logistics limitations or delays, labor-related challenges, limitations or regulations affecting trade flows (such as concerning genetically modified organisms), local currency concerns, and other economic and political instability.  Political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes, fees, etc.  Economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and ability to execute its long-term business strategies, thus reducing the Company’s overall market value.11Government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; and political instability could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, the volume and types of imports and exports, the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company’s products, and industry profitability.  For example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel, including but not limited to changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, can have an impact on the Company’s operating results.  International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.  Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Protection Act, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Company’s agricultural commodity risk management practices as well as the Company’s futures commission merchant business.  Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products; restrict the Company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.The Company’s operating results could be affected by changes in other governmental policies, mandates, and regulations including monetary, fiscal and environmental policies, laws, regulations, acquisition approvals, and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations.  These risks include but are not limited to changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes, and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases.  International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Company’s ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.The Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio.  Government policies, including anti-trust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, and other government regulations and mandates, can impact the Company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully.The Company is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.The Company is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, product safety or quality; shifting consumer preferences; federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable farming practices; environmental, health and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims.  The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company.  In addition, negative publicity caused by product liability and food safety matters may damage the Company’s reputation.  The occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.Certain of the Company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  The Company is subject to risks associated with economic or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses, including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry.  An outbreak of disease could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  A decrease in demand for ingredients in livestock and poultry feed could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.12The Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and forward strategy.The Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in 165 countries.  The Company is required to comply with the numerous and broad-reaching laws and regulations administered by United States federal, state and local, and foreign governmental authorities.  The Company must comply with other general business regulations such as accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, environmental, and handling and production of regulated substances.  The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  As examples, the Company has received large tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil and Argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company covering various prior periods.  Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation.The production of the Company’s products requires the use of materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including greenhouse gas emissions.  Although the Company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, failure to comply with these laws and regulations can have serious consequences, including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the Company’s reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations.In addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations, for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws, may require the Company to modify existing processing facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results.The Company is exposed to potential business disruption, including but not limited to disruption of transportation services, supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and accidents which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.The Company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services.  A disruption in transportation services could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Company’s facilities and impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner.  The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively.  If access to these navigable waters is interrupted, the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the Company’s processing operations, are not available, the Company’s business could be disrupted.  Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results.  Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Company’s control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, interruption of energy supply, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions.The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism, for example, economic adulteration of the Company’s products, or war, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, and fires. The potential effects of these conditions could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.13The Company’s business is capital-intensive in nature and the Company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs.  Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.The Company requires significant capital, including access to credit markets from time to time, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy.  The Company’s working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.  The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations and changing safety standards in the industry.  Moreover, the expansion of the Company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital.  Access to credit markets and pricing of the Company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies.  Sufficient credit ratings allow the Company to access tier one commercial paper markets.  If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected.  If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Company’s current operations and its growth opportunities which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.The Company’s risk management strategies may not be effective. The Company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company monitors position limits and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks.  The Company’s monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure.  If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the Company’s exposure to these fluctuations, it could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures. The Company has $3.9 billion invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments over which the Company has limited control as to the governance and management activities of these investments.  Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.0 billion.  The Company faces certain risks, including risks related to the financial strength of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to implement beneficial management strategies, including risk management and compliance monitoring, with respect to the investment’s activities; and the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the investment partner.  The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues or financial results related to these investments that may impact the Company’s revenues and operating results.The Company’s information technology (IT) systems, processes, and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches, or failures which may affect the Company’s ability to conduct its business. The Company’s operations rely on certain key IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data connectivity, information and services for internal and external users.  These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, risk management activities, converting raw materials to finished products, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business.  Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company’s third party data.  The Company has put in place security measures to protect itself against cyber-based attacks and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems.  However, if the Company’s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company’s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Company’s revenues, operating results, and financial condition.14The Company has no unresolved staff comments.The Company owns or leases, under operating leases, the following processing plants and procurement facilities:The Company’s operations are such that most products are efficiently processed near the source of raw materials.  Consequently, the Company has many plants strategically located in agricultural commodity producing areas.  The annual volume of commodities processed will vary depending upon availability of raw materials and demand for finished products.  The Company also owns approximately 290 warehouses and terminals primarily used as bulk storage facilities and 39 innovation centers.  Warehouses, terminals, corporate, and sales offices are not included in the tables above.  Processing plants and procurement facilities owned or leased by unconsolidated joint ventures are also not included in the tables above.To enhance the efficiency of transporting large quantities of raw materials and finished products between the Company’s procurement facilities and processing plants and also the final delivery of products to our customers around the world, the Company owns approximately 2,000 barges, 13,400 rail cars, 200 trucks, 1,300 trailers, and 10 oceangoing vessels; and leases, under operating leases, approximately 500 barges, 14,800 rail cars, 400 trucks, 110 trailers and 21 oceangoing vessels. 15*The U.S. plants are located in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.16 *The U.S. procurement facilities are located in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin.17*The U.S. processing plants are located in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington.* The U.S. procurement facilities are located in Idaho, Iowa, and Minnesota. 18*The U.S. plants in the table above are located in Alabama,  Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.19 *The U.S. procurement facilities are located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.  20*The U.S. processing plants are located in California, Illinois, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota,  Ohio, Oregon, and Washington.*The U.S. procurement facilities are located in Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wyoming.21The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 in Item 8 for information on income tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.  See Note 21 of Item 8 for information on the Company’s legal proceedings.    None.22PART IICommon Stock Market Prices and DividendsThe Company’s common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

All rights reserved.24Selected Financial Data(In millions, except ratio and per share data)Prior periods have been restated for the adoption of the amended guidance of Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest, and the reclassification of capitalized software costs from net property, plant, and equipment to goodwill and other intangible assets (see Note 1 in Item 8 for more information).Significant items affecting the comparability of the financial data shown above are as follows:25 26Company OverviewThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.The Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in 165 countries.  The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities.The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable business segments: Agricultural Services, Corn Processing, Oilseeds Processing, and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.  See Note 17 of Item 8 for more information about the Company’s business segments.Effective January 1, 2015, the Company has formed a fourth reportable business segment, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Results of Wild Flavors and SCI, which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, are reported in this segment in addition to results of certain product lines previously reported in the Agricultural Services, Corn Processing, and Oilseeds Processing business segments.  Prior period results of the product lines previously reported in the other reportable business segments have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.The Company’s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include:The construction of the new feed plant facilities in China and Minnesota and the soy protein facility in Brazil, and the expansion of the export facilities in Argentina, are expected to be completed in 2016.  The pending transactions are expected to close in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals. 27As part of the evolution of the Company’s strategic plan, the Company is currently undertaking a fresh look at the capital intensity of its operations and portfolio, seeking innovative ways to reduce and redeploy capital in its efforts to drive long-term returns, including a strategic review of its U.S. corn dry mills and options for its Brazilian sugarcane ethanol business.  Based on the uncertain outlook of the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol business at year-end, the Company continues to evaluate all options but doesn’t expect to operate the plant after this year’s seasonal shutdown.  The financial impacts arising from these portfolio actions are described on pages 31 and 33 and in the relevant notes in Item 8.Operating Performance IndicatorsThe Company’s agricultural services and oilseeds processing operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  Therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.The Company’s corn processing operations and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold.  Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in 82 countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency.  Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar.The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, EBITDA, economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses.  The Company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”28Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results.  Agricultural Services was negatively impacted by the ample global supply of agricultural commodities which limited merchandising opportunities, reduced demand for North American grain exports, and moderated commodity prices throughout the year.  The increase in global supply was due to several large harvests which built up world grain stocks to historically high levels.  In addition, the U.S. dollar continued to be firm against weakening global currencies, particularly those in major crop growing countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Ukraine.  This resulted in margin pressure and decreased North American export volumes most of the year, partially offset by higher domestic grain demand.  Transportation was also impacted by the decreased North American export volumes as well as lower global freight rates. Demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid while co-product prices weakened.  Ethanol demand remained strong both in North America and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol’s continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer.  Despite strong demand, ethanol margins were weak due to record-high levels of  U.S. industry production for most of the year, leading to excess inventory.  Overall demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong, especially in North America.  South American oilseeds saw significantly higher volumes and margins for grain origination and exports due to the significant depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.  Lower softseed availability affected seed basis, resulting in lower softseed crushing volumes and weaker margins, particularly in Europe.  Biodiesel demand resulting from international biofuel standards continued to support demand for crude and refined vegetable oil, although demand for biodiesel was softer throughout 2015 due to weaker economic conditions in certain countries.  The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business continued to focus on cost synergies and new revenue opportunities amid economic uncertainty in many emerging economies and some softening in demand.  Customers’ interest to develop innovative, healthy, and nutritious food products in response to macro trends in diet and demographics remained strong and continued to grow.Net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased $0.4 billion to $1.8 billion.   Segment operating profit was down 16%, due primarily to weaker ethanol margins and lower volumes and margins of North American grain exports. Corporate results in the current year include a charge of $189 million related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, in addition to a credit of $2 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a LIFO credit of $245 million in the prior year.Income taxes decreased from $877 million to $438 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a decreased effective tax rate.  The Company’s effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 19% compared to 28% for 2014 due primarily to low tax rates on significant one-time gains related to portfolio actions, a $70 million favorable impact of discrete items, mainly the release of a $66 million valuation allowance, and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings (see Note 13 in Item 8 for more information).Analysis of Statements of EarningsProcessed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in metric tons):The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.  Record volumes of oilseeds were processed during the year, increased from the prior year as a result of the strong demand environment for soybean meal.  Processed volumes of corn were decreased in response to high ethanol industry production which outpaced demand throughout the year.  Processed volumes of cocoa beans decreased due to the sale of the global cocoa business in October 2015.29Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:Revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds Processing and Agricultural Services, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.  Revenues decreased 17% due principally to lower sales prices ($12.9 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.6 billion).  Sales prices decreased principally due to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices, in particular prices of soybeans, corn, and wheat, and $5.8 billion in foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the U.S. dollar.  Agricultural Services revenues decreased 18% primarily due to lower sales prices ($5.3 billion) and lower sales volumes ($1.3 billion).  Corn Processing revenues decreased 19% due principally to lower sales prices ($1.9 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.4 billion).  Oilseeds Processing revenues decreased 18% due principally to lower sales prices ($5.5 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.2 billion).  Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients revenues increased 76% due principally to higher sales volumes resulting from the inclusion of the full year results of Wild Flavors and SCI, which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 ($1.2 billion), partially offset by lower prices ($0.2 billion). 30Cost of products sold decreased $12.8 billion to $63.7 billion due principally to lower average commodity prices, including $5.6 billion from foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, and lower manufacturing costs.   Included in cost of products sold is a credit of $2 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $245 million in the prior year.  Manufacturing expenses decreased $291 million to $5.5 billion primarily due to lower fuel prices, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs due to the inclusion of the full year costs for WILD Flavors and SCI.Gross profit decreased $0.7 billion, or 16%, to $4.0 billion due principally to lower ethanol margins ($0.6 billion) and foreign currency translation impacts ($0.2 billion).  The inclusion of the full year results of Wild Flavors and SCI was partially offset by lower credit from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on LIFO valuation reserves. These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 33.  The decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $103 million to $2.0 billion due principally to increased expenses of $219 million related to the inclusion of the full year results of Wild Flavors and SCI in the current year compared to three-month results in the prior year partially offset by decreased pension expense primarily due to a $98 million one-time pension settlement in the prior year.Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs recognized in the current year of $200 million consisted of long-lived asset  impairments of $129 million related to certain Oilseeds Processing facilities, sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil, a facility in the Corn Processing segment, and capitalized software costs and restructuring and exit costs of $71 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil, and other restructuring and exit costs.  Long-lived asset impairment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of property, plant, and equipment asset impairments of $70 million in the Corn Processing segment, $49 million in the Oilseeds Processing segment, $1 million in the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment, and $9 million in Corporate.  Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs recognized in the prior year of $105 million consisted of costs associated with the relocation of the Company’s global headquarters to Chicago, Illinois of $16 million, restructuring charges related primarily to the Wild Flavors acquisition and to the integration of a subsidiary following the acquisition of the minority interest of $48 million, other-than-temporary investment writedown of $6 million, and fixed asset impairments of $35 million.Interest expense declined $29 million to $308 million primarily due to lower interest rates resulting from the issuance of Euro-denominated debt and the repurchase of certain of the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated outstanding debentures.Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $18 million to $390 million primarily due to higher earnings from the Company’s investment in CIP.Other income increased $74 million from $247 million to $321 million.  Other income in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of gain on sales of $256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, a gain of $212 million on the revaluation of the Company’s previously held equity investments in North Start Shipping, Minmetal, and Eaststarch C.V. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, and a gain of $62 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the Barcarena export terminal facility in Brazil to Glencore plc, partially offset by a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt in the current year and loss provisions of $45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil.  Other income in the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of gains of $156 million upon the Company’s effective dilution in the Pacificor joint venture and $126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business, partially offset by losses of $102 million on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the Wild Flavors acquisition.31Operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:Corporate results are as follows:32Agricultural Services operating profit decreased 32%.  Merchandising and Handling results decreased on fewer merchandising opportunities and lower margins due to ample global supplies of grain, reduced U.S. export competitiveness during the second half of the year due to the strong U.S. dollar, and a large South American harvest.  Also contributing to the decrease were the absence of a prior year gain of $17 million related to a partial recovery of a loss provision and a prior year gain of $156 million from the Company’s effective dilution in the Pacificor joint venture, partially offset by a $27 million current year gain on the revaluation of the Company’s previously held investments in North Star Shipping and Minmetal in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests.  Milling and Other results improved due to higher product margins and strong merchandising results.  Transportation results declined due to lower freight rates and volumes driven by reduced U.S. export volumes in the second half of the year.Corn Processing operating profit decreased 44%.  Included in the current year operating profit is approximately $13 million of mark-to-market losses related to hedge timing effects compared to $25 million of gains in the prior year.  Excluding these items, Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $213 million due principally to the $185 million gain from the revaluation of the Company’s previously held investment in Eaststarch C.V. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest in November 2015.  Also contributing to the increase were lower raw material costs and good demand relative to supply of products.  Excluding hedge timing effects, Bioproducts operating profit declined by $675 million primarily due to lower industry ethanol margins.  Strong industry production levels resulted in high industry inventory levels which kept industry margins considerably lower than last year, despite increased domestic and export demand.  Also contributing to the decrease were restructuring and fixed asset impairment charges of $75 million and loss provisions of $45 million related to the sugar ethanol business in Brazil.Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 9%.  Included in the current year operating profit is $45 million of mark-to-market gains related to cocoa hedge timing effects compared to $17 million of losses in the prior year.   Crushing and Origination operating profit includes a current year gain of $62 million related to the sale of assets to the new Barcarena export terminal joint venture in Brazil and a prior year gain of $126 million related to the sale of the fertilizer business.  Excluding these gains, Crushing and Origination operating profit increased $38 million primarily due to strong North American & European soybean crushing volumes and margins through the first half of the year, driven by strong demand and an ample global bean supply.  Starting in the third quarter and continuing in the fourth quarter, global soybean crush margins declined as the more competitive Argentine meal was anticipated to enter the already well-supplied global markets due to changes in Argentine policies.  Softseed margins and volumes were lower, particularly in Europe, resulting from weaker global demand for vegetable oil.  Large South American corn and soybean harvests also helped support a significant improvement in South America origination results.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other operating profit declined primarily due to lower South American and European results partially offset by improved margins in North American oil refining operations.  Excluding hedge timing effects, Cocoa and Other results increased $149 million.  The current year gain of $244 million on the sale of the global cocoa and chocolate business was partially offset by lower earnings due to the sale of these businesses and lower cocoa press margins and peanut processing results.  Asia results declined due principally to long-lived asset and goodwill impairments partially offset by an increase from the Company’s share of its results from its equity investee, Wilmar.Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients operating profit increased due primarily to the acquisitions of Wild Flavors and SCI during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.  Incremental earnings from these acquisitions were partially offset by lower overall results in the other specialty ingredients businesses due to weakness in many emerging economies and a strong U.S. dollar, which reduced volumes and margins across a number of product lines.Corporate results were a net charge of $988 million in the current period compared to $785 million in the prior period.  The effects of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $2 million in the current year compared to a credit of $245 million in the prior year.  Interest expense - net declined due principally to lower interest rates.  Unallocated corporate costs increased $19 million due primarily to increased pension expense resulting from the adoption of a new mortality assumption, increased spending on the Company’s ERP program and various strategic business improvement projects, partially offset by lower employee compensation expense. Other charges in the current year consisted of a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, restructuring charges of $29 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, and asset impairment and settlement charges of $24 million.  Other charges in the prior year consisted of a $102 million loss on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the Wild Flavors acquisition, costs associated with the relocation of the Company’s global headquarters to Chicago, Illinois of $16 million, restructuring charges related to the Alfred C. Toepfer International integration and other restructuring charges of $15 million, and pension settlement of $98 million.  Minority interest and other expense in the prior year consisted primarily of a $56 million loss related to the Company’s equity method investment in CIP.33Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.  These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.  Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.  The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.  Management believes that adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of the Company’s profitability and enhance the investor’s understanding of the Company’s financial performance.  Adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP. The reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, are provided in the following table.(1)  Tax effected using the Company’s U.S. effective tax rate.(2)  Tax effected using the applicable tax rates.The reconciliation of earnings before income taxes to adjusted EBITDA  and adjusted EBITDA by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are provided in the following table.3435Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013 As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results.  Demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong and steady.  Demand for export of North American corn and soybeans was strong, but logistical challenges during the winter months, including rail delays and river freezes, caused higher costs making U.S. exports less competitive.  Despite a large harvest in South America, U.S. grain exports continued for longer than normal in 2014 due to slow South American farmer selling.  U.S. corn and wheat storage and merchandising opportunities were limited for much of the year until the 2014 record fall harvest.  Corn sweetener demand was steady.  Strong U.S. ethanol demand from both domestic and export markets, combined with industry logistical and production challenges in the winter months, led to volatile but strong overall 2014 ethanol margins. South American grain and oilseed origination volumes and margins were challenged by the slow farmer selling.  Cocoa press margins have continued to improve from last year when margins were negatively impacted by excess capacity.Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $0.9 billion to $2.2 billion.   Segment operating profit was $3.9 billion, up 45%, due primarily to improved corn processing and grain merchandising and handling results.  Included in the 2014 segment operating profit was a gain of approximately $156 million upon the Company’s effective dilution in the Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units, a gain of $126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business, long-lived asset impairment charges of $35 million, and Wild Flavors restructuring charges and acquisition costs of $33 million.  In 2013, segment operating profit included a $155 million write-down related to the Company’s GrainCorp investment, a $51 million impairment of certain long-lived assets at its Brazilian sugar mill, and approximately $27 million of other long-lived asset impairment charges principally in the Corn Processing segment.  Excluding these unique items, segment operating profit improved approximately 26% in 2014.  Corporate costs of $785 million in 2014 were higher by $101 million.  Included in 2014 costs were losses of $102 million on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated Wild Flavors acquisition and $98 million of non-cash pension settlement charges.  Included in 2013 costs were $54 million of charges related to an anti-corruption settlement, losses of $40 million on Australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed GrainCorp acquisition, $21 million costs related to strategic projects, and costs of $32 million primarily related to asset write-downs and allocations of costs between corporate and the operating segments.  In 2014, LIFO inventory reserves declined resulting in pretax LIFO credits to earnings of $245 million compared to LIFO credits of $225 million in 2013.  Excluding LIFO and these other items, corporate costs increased $68 million, which is primarily due to higher enterprise resource planning project, I.T., and other project-related costs.  Partially offsetting the increase was lower interest expense due principally to lower outstanding long-term debt balances.    The Company’s effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.0% compared to 33.1% for 2013.  The 2014 rate was positively impacted by $47 million of positive discrete tax adjustments and a slight favorable shift in the geographic mix of earnings.  The 2013 rate was negatively impacted by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, partially offset by favorable discrete income tax benefits related to amounts received from the U.S. government in the form of biodiesel credits.  Excluding these factors, the effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 30%.  Analysis of Statements of EarningsProcessed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in metric tons):The Company continued to operate its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.36Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:Revenues in 2014 decreased 10% due principally to lower average sales prices ($8.0 billion) related to a decrease in underlying commodity prices, lower overall sales volumes ($0.7 billion), and changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.2 billion partially offset by higher revenues in Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients ($0.3 billion) due to the acquisition of Wild Flavors and SCI.  The decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on cost of products sold.  Agricultural Services revenues decreased 10% due principally to lower average sales prices ($5.2 billion) and partially offset by higher sales volumes ($1.1 billion).  Corn Processing revenues decreased 11% due principally to lower average sales prices ($1.6 billion) partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.1 billion).  Oilseeds Processing revenues decreased 10% due principally to lower sales volumes for soybeans and soybean meal ($1.9 billion) and lower average sales prices ($1.4 billion).   Cost of products sold decreased 11% to $76.4 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.   Included in 2014 cost of products sold is a credit of $245 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $225 million in 2013.  Manufacturing expenses increased $0.2 billion to $5.8 billion mostly due to higher energy costs and higher maintenance costs.  Higher energy costs were driven by unusually high volatility of natural gas prices during the winter months early in the year due primarily to supply interruptions impacted by the severe winter weather conditions.37Gross profit increased $0.9 billion, or 23%, to $4.8 billion.  The increase in gross profit consists principally of stronger margins in ethanol ($0.4 billion), increased margins in cocoa ($0.1 billion), higher U.S. grain export volumes ($0.3 billion), higher volumes and freight rates in barge operations ($0.1 billion), and the inclusion of the results of Wild Flavors ($0.1 billion), partially offset by lower South American grain origination results ($0.1 billion).  These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 40.  The effects of decreasing commodity price changes on LIFO inventory valuations had an immaterial impact on gross profit.  The decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold.Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $148 million to $1.9 billion due principally to a $98 million non-cash pretax pension settlement charge related to settling certain U.S. retiree liabilities with lump sum payments and incremental SG&A expenses of $73 million related to the acquired Wild Flavors and SCI businesses, partially offset by the absence of the prior year charge of $54 million related to an anti-corruption settlement.  In addition, salaries and benefits and enterprise resource planning project, information technology, and other project-related costs were higher year over year. Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs of $105 million include $16 million of costs associated with the relocation of the Company’s global headquarters to Chicago, Illinois, $48 million of restructuring charges related primarily to the Wild Flavors acquisition and Toepfer integration following the acquisition of the minority interest, other-than-temporary investment writedown of $6 million, and property, plant, and equipment asset impairments of $35 million.  The 2013 charges of $259 million were comprised of other-than-temporary impairment charges of $155 million on the Company’s GrainCorp investment, asset impairment charges of $51 million related to the Company’s Brazilian sugar milling business, and other impairment charges principally for certain property, plant, and equipment assets totaling $53 million.  Interest expense decreased $76 million to $337 million primarily due to lower outstanding long-term debt balances.  During February 2014, the Company repaid $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes with available funds.Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $39 million to $372 million primarily due to lower earnings from the Company’s investments in CIP and Wilmar.Other income increased $194 million to $247 million due principally to a gain of $156 million upon the Company’s effective dilution in the Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units, a gain of $126 million on the sale of the South American fertilizer business, and the absence of prior year losses of $40 million on Australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed GrainCorp acquisition, partially offset by current period losses of $102 million on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the Wild Flavors acquisition.   38Operating profit by segment and earnings before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:Corporate results are as follows:39Agricultural Services operating profit increased 205%.  2014 results in Merchandising and Handling include a gain of $156 million upon the Company’s effective dilution in the Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units and asset impairment charges of $14 million.  Prior year results included an approximately $30 million intercompany insurance-related gain and a $155 million asset impairment charge related to the other than temporary impairment of the Company’s GrainCorp investment.  Excluding these items, Merchandising and Handling operating profit increased $353 million due principally to higher U.S. grain export volumes and improvement in international merchandising results.  Transportation operating profit improved due to higher volumes and freight rates in barge operations.  Milling and Other results declined on lower margins and volumes in the milling business for most of 2014 reducing opportunities for grain and feed merchandising.Corn Processing operating profit increased 49%.  Included in the 2014 operating profit is a gain of approximately $25 million for corn hedge timing effects and $15 million of asset impairment charges; while 2013 included a charge of approximately $15 million for corn hedge time effects and $71 million of asset impairment charges.  Excluding these items, Sweeteners and Starches operating profit decreased $49 million primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by lower net corn costs.  Also contributing to the decrease were decreased co-products income, an additional $8 million in bad debt reserve and $7 million of startup costs related to the new sweetener facility in Tianjin, China.  Excluding corn hedge timing effects and asset impairment charges, Bioproducts profit in the current year improved by $328 million as solid demand for U.S. ethanol from domestic and export markets, lower net corn costs, and lower industry production volumes early in the year caused by logistical and production challenges combined to drive volatile but overall strong margins.Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased 12%.  Included in the 2014 operating profit is a charge of approximately $17 million for cocoa hedge timing effects compared to a charge of approximately $13 million in the prior year.  Crushing and Origination operating profit increased 4%.  Included in the 2014 results is a gain on sale of the fertilizer business of $126 million.  Excluding this gain the Crushing and Origination operating profit decreased by $93 million primarily due to lower South American grain origination results caused by year-over-year slower farmer-selling, reduced crush margins and lower fertilizer results partially offset by strong soybean and softseed volumes and margins in North America and Europe.  Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results improved on good demand and improved margins for refined and packaged oils and improved European biodiesel results.  Cocoa and Other results, including the mark-to-market timing effects discussed above, improved as cocoa press margins significantly increased.  Asia results declined principally reflecting a decrease from the Company’s share of its results from its equity investee, Wilmar.Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients operating profit decreased due primarily to the results of Wild Flavors and SCI, which were acquired by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Wild Flavors’ results include $33 million in restructuring charges and acquisition costs and $23 million in additional expense for the amortization of fair value adjustments primarily related to inventories.  Other financial operating profit increased mainly due to the absence of an approximately $30 million insurance-related loss in the 2013 which offset the insurance-related gain reported in the Agricultural Services segment.Corporate results were a net charge of $785 million in 2014 compared to a net charge of $684 million in 2013.  The effects of decreasing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $245 million in 2014 compared to a credit of $225 million in 2013.  Interest expense - net declined due principally to lower outstanding long-term debt balances.  Unallocated corporate costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to the enterprise resource planning project, special strategic projects, and compensation accruals.  Other charges in 2014 consisted of losses of $102 million on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated Wild Flavors acquisition, global headquarters relocation costs of $16 million,  integration of a subsidiary following the acquisition of the minority interest and other restructuring charges of $15 million, and pension settlement of $98 million.  Other charges in 2013 consisted of a $54 million provision related to an anti-corruption settlement, losses of $40 million on Australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed GrainCorp acquisition, $21 million of costs related to strategic merger and acquisition projects, and $32 million of costs primarily related to asset write-downs and reallocations of costs from the operating segments to corporate.  Minority interest and other expense increased primarily due to changes in the elimination of the income attributable to the minority shareholder of a subsidiary.40Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.  These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.  Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.  The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.  Management believes that adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of the Company’s profitability and enhance the investor’s understanding of the Company’s financial performance.  Adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the Company’s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures.  The primary source of funds to finance the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.Cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion for 2015 compared to $5.0 billion in 2014.  Working capital changes were a net source of cash of $0.2 billion in the current year compared to $2.3 billion in the prior year.  Inventories declined approximately $0.9 billion at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 due to lower prices partially offset by higher inventory quantities.  In 2015, the Company made a $0.2 billion voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plans.  No similar contribution was made in 2014.  Cash used in investing activities was $21 million this year compared to $3.4 billion last year primarily due to capital expenditures and net assets of businesses acquired of $1.6 billion this year compared to $3.7 billion last year and proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of $1.8 billion this compared to $0.4 billion last year.  Cash used in financing activities was $2.6 billion this year compared to $3.6 billion last year.  Long-term debt borrowings in the current year include the €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) Notes issued on June 24, 2015.  Long-term debt payments in the current period include the purchase of $935 million aggregate principal amount of certain of the Company’s outstanding debentures for $1.1 billion pursuant to the cash tender offers and debt redemption while the prior period included the $1.15 billion convertible debt settled with available cash in February 2014.  Treasury stock purchases were $2.0 billion in the current year compared to $1.2 billion in last year.  At December 31, 2015, the Company had $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.6 to 1.  Included in working capital is $5.1 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  At December 31, 2015, the Company’s capital resources included shareholders’ equity of $17.9 billion and lines of credit totaling $5.7 billion, of which $5.6 billion was unused.  The Company’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) was 24% at December 31, 2015 and 22% at December 31, 2014.  The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Company’s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  The Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders’ equity) was 20% at December 31, 2015 and 17% at December 31, 2014.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $4.0 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $0.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested.  Based on the Company’s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $4.4 billion, the Company has asserted that these funds are permanently reinvested outside the U.S.  The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs ( the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  The Programs provide the Company with up to $1.6 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expands the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 20 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs).  As of December 31, 2015, the Company utilized $1.2 billion of its facility under the Programs.On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019.  The Company has acquired approximately 43.3 million shares under this program.The Company expects capital expenditures of $1.0 billion during 2016.  In 2016, the Company expects additional cash outlays of approximately $0.7 billion in dividends, $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in share repurchases, subject to strategic capital requirements, and approximately $130 million upon the completion of the previously-announced Harvest Innovations, Medsofts Group, and Morocco corn plant transactions.  43The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2015.The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks. On July 1, 2015, the Company accepted for purchase $794 million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding debentures (the “Debentures”) validly tendered and not withdrawn.  Pursuant to the terms of its previously announced cash tender offers, the Company paid aggregate total consideration of $961 million for the Debentures accepted for purchase.  In September 2015, the Company redeemed $141 million of its 5.45% outstanding debentures for $156 million.  To finance the cash tender offers and debt redemption, the Company issued Euro-denominated debt on June 24, 2015 (see Note 10 in Item 8).  The Company recognized a debt extinguishment charge of $189 million, including transaction expenses of $7 million, in 2015 pertaining to these transactions.On July 31, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its global chocolate business to Cargill, Inc. for $431 million.  The Company recorded a gain on disposal of $38 million, net of transaction expenses, in the Oilseeds Processing segment in the year ended December 31, 2015.On October 16, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Eatem Foods Company, a leading developer and producer of premium traditional, natural, and organic savory flavor systems, for $160 million, and closed on the sale of its global cocoa business to Olam International Limited for approximately $1.2 billion, subject to post-closing adjustments.On November 2, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in Eaststarch C.V. for €240 million (approximately $265 million), subject to post-closing adjustments.Contractual ObligationsIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future.  The following table sets forth the Company’s significant future obligations by time period.  Purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Company’s normal business activities.  The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $49 million as of December 31, 2015 as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement.  Where applicable, information included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.44 (1) Includes pension contributions of $31 million for fiscal 2016.  The Company is unable to estimate the amount of pension contributions beyond fiscal year 2016.  For more information concerning the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans, see Note 15 in Item 8.At December 31, 2015, the Company estimates it will spend approximately $1.5 billion through fiscal year 2020 to complete currently approved capital projects which are not included in the table above.  The Company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $0.8 billion at December 31, 2015.The Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments.  The Company’s liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation.  The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.  At December 31, 2015, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $4 million.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsAccounts Receivable Securitization ProgramsThe Company has an accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  See Note 20 of Item 8 for more information about these programs.  Synthetic Leasing ProgramThe Company is a party to lease agreements under synthetic leasing programs for certain of its U.S. barge and trucking assets for periods ranging from 5 to 7 years.  As of December 31, 2015, outstanding lease balances, including the value of the underlying assets of $141 million, were off-balance sheet.  These agreements provide the Company with the right to use these assets for specified periods in exchange for an obligation to make rental payments.  The agreements are accounted for as operating leases, such that the rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings.  The future lease payments pertaining to these lease agreements are included in the contractual obligations table in Item 7.  These leasing programs are utilized primarily to diversify funding sources and to retain flexibility.  The Company recorded $5 million, $5 million, and $3 million of rent expense pertaining to synthetic lease payments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.45Critical Accounting PoliciesThe process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity DerivativesCertain of the Company’s inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 are valued at estimated fair values, including $4.1 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $0.8 billion of derivative assets, $0.6 billion of derivative liabilities, and $0.7 billion of inventory-related payables.  Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts for agricultural commodities.  Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  The Company’s inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $1.2 billion of assets and $0.1 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Note 3 in Item 8.  Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.Derivatives – Designated Hedging ActivitiesThe Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the Company’s anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.  These designated hedging programs principally relate to the Company’s Corn Processing operating segment.  Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  See Note 4 in Item 8 for additional information.Investments in AffiliatesThe Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its 19.0% investment in Wilmar.  These investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.  However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.  If management used a different accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the Company recognizes may materially differ.46Income TaxesThe Company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  These standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  For example, the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil and Argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company.  The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Company’s income statement.  The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  The Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.  Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely.  During 2015, the Company decreased valuation allowances by approximately $45 million primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and asset impairments.  To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $9.6 billion at December 31, 2015, are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon.  If the Company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the Company could be subject to U.S. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.Property, Plant, and Equipment and Asset Abandonments and Write-DownsThe Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  Both the availability of the Company’s raw materials and the demand for the Company’s finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Company’s raw materials and finished products.  Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Company’s assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.  The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  Management evaluates the Company’s property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  Assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were $108 million, $35 million, and $84 million, respectively (see Note 19 in Item 8 for additional information).47Business CombinationsThe Company’s acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations, are adjusted to fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.  Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates.  Although management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, actual results may differ. Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 47 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and intangibles of $21 million and $9 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013, respectively (see Note 19 in Item 8 for more information).  There were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2014.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.Employee Benefit PlansThe Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  The Company provides eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are “grandfathered” into subsidized coverage while others are provided with Health Care Reimbursement Accounts).  In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  These estimates and assumptions are based on the Company’s historical experience combined with management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.The market risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company’s net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below.CommoditiesThe availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.48The Company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for, and produced in, its business operations, by entering into derivative and non-derivative contracts which reduce the Company’s overall short or long commodity position.  Additionally, the Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.The Company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sales contracts, energy and freight contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts including contracts used to hedge portions of production requirements, net of sales. The fair value of the Company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy.  The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits, and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95% confidence level, that could be incurred over a one year period.  Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly.In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices.  The highest, lowest, and average weekly position for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10% adverse price change is as follows:The decrease in fair value of the average position for December 31, 2015 was the result of a decrease in average quantities underlying the weekly commodity position and also a decrease in prices.CurrenciesThe Company has consolidated subsidiaries in 82 countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland and Brazil where the Euro and U.S. dollar are the functional currencies, respectively.  To reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real currencies.  These currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur.  The Company does not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.  The currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter options.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material.49The amount the Company considers permanently invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates and translated into dollars using the year-end exchange rates is $8.0 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014.  The depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar of $1.0 billion was offset by the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.  The potential loss in fair value, which would principally be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income, resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $809 million and $802 million for December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Actual results may differ.InterestThe fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long-term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates.  Actual results may differ.The decrease in fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the debt repurchase and increased interest rates partially offset by the issuance of new Euro-denominated bonds.5051Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyConsolidated Statements of Earnings See notes to consolidated financial statements.52Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)  See notes to consolidated financial statements.53Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyConsolidated Balance Sheets See notes to consolidated financial statements.54Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyConsolidated Statements of Cash FlowsSee notes to consolidated financial statements.55Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ EquitySee notes to consolidated financial statements.56Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesNature of BusinessThe Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs), in which it has a controlling financial interest.  For VIEs, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard.  Investments in affiliates, including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities, are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  The Company’s portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements.  In each case, the financial statements are within 93 days of the Company’s year end and are consistent from period to period.  Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.ReclassificationsEffective January 1, 2015, the Company formed a fourth reportable business segment, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Results of Wild Flavors Gmbh (Wild Flavors) and Specialty Commodities, Inc. (SCI), which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, are reported in this segment in addition to results of certain product lines previously reported in the Oilseeds Processing, Corn Processing, and Agricultural Services business segments.  Throughout this annual report on Form 10-K, prior period results of the product lines previously reported in the other reportable business segments have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Effective April 1, 2015, the Company early adopted the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest, which addresses the balance sheet presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discounts and premiums.Capitalized software costs of $109 million in 2014, previously included in net property, plant, and equipment, have been reclassified to goodwill and other intangible assets to conform to the current period presentation.Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.Segregated Cash and InvestmentsThe Company segregates certain cash and investment balances in accordance with regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, insurance arrangements, and lending arrangements.  These segregated balances represent deposits received from customers of the Company’s registered futures commission merchant, securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash and securities pledged as security under certain insurance or lending arrangements.  Segregated cash and investments primarily consist of cash, United States government securities, and money-market funds.57Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)ReceivablesThe Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value.  This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts of $70 million and $81 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances.  The Company estimates this allowance based on its history of write-offs, level of past-due accounts, and its relationships with, and the economic status of, its customers.  Portions of the allowance for uncollectible accounts are recorded in trade receivables, other current assets, and other assets.Credit risk on receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diversified nature of the Company’s worldwide customer base.  The Company manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.  Collateral is generally not required for the Company’s receivables.Accounts receivable due from unconsolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $35 million and $15 million, respectively.InventoriesInventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the lower of cost, determined by either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods, or market.The following table sets forth the Company’s inventories as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.58Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.  Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value:  Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2:  Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.  Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.Based on historical experience with the Company’s suppliers and customers, the Company’s own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.  However, in certain cases, if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the contract in Level 3.In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.  The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.  The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.The Company’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.  DerivativesThe Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet.  Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.  The majority of the Company’s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments, and as such, changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.  For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.  For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument that is in excess of the cumulative change in the cash flows of the hedged item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion), hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period. 59Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)Marketable SecuritiesThe Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reported as a component of AOCI.  The Company monitors its investments for impairment periodically, and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other-than-temporary.  The Company uses the specific identification method when securities are sold or reclassified out of AOCI into earnings.  The Company considers marketable securities maturing in less than one year as short-term.  All other marketable securities are classified as long-term.Property, Plant, and EquipmentProperty, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost.  Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company generally uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings - 5 to 40 years; machinery and equipment - 3 to 40 years.  The Company capitalized interest on major construction projects in progress of $11 million, $18 million, and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, general and administrative expenses.Goodwill and other intangible assetsGoodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 47 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company’s accounting policy is to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever there were indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company recorded impairment charges for goodwill and intangibles totaling $21 million related to computer software, certain of the Company’s international Oilseeds Processing facilities, and a facility in its Corn Processing segment during the year ended December 31, 2015, and $9 million related to the Company’s Brazilian sugar milling business during the year ended December 31, 2013.  There were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2014. Asset Abandonments and Write-DownsThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  Assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the Company’s ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  Fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analysis which relies on management’s estimate of market participant assumptions (a Level 3 measurement under applicable accounting standards).  During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, impairment charges were $108 million, $35 million, and $84 million, respectively (see Note 19 for additional information). 60Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)Payables to Brokerage CustomersPayables to brokerage customers represent the total of customer accounts at the Company’s futures commission merchant with credit or positive balances.  Customer accounts are used primarily in connection with commodity transactions and include gains and losses on open commodity trades as well as securities and other deposits made for margins or other purpose as required by the Company or the exchange-clearing organizations or counterparties.  Payables to brokerage customers have a corresponding balance in segregated cash and investments and customer omnibus receivable in other current assets.  RevenuesThe Company follows a policy of recognizing sales revenue at the time of delivery of the product and when all of the following have occurred: a sales agreement is in place, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  The Company has sales contracts that allow for pricing to occur after title of the goods has passed to the customer.  In these cases, the Company continues to report the goods in inventory until it recognizes the sales revenue once the price has been determined.  Freight costs and handling charges related to sales are recorded as a component of cost of products sold.Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $5.0 billion, $5.8 billion, and $6.9 billion, respectively.Stock CompensationThe Company recognizes expense for its stock compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted.  The Company’s stock compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options.  The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and a lattice valuation model, respectively.  These valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions.  Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock compensation award.Research and DevelopmentCosts associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.  Such costs incurred, net of expenditures subsequently reimbursed by government grants, were $122 million, $79 million, and $59 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Per Share DataBasic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  In computing diluted earnings per share, average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares using the treasury share method.Business CombinationsThe Company’s acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations, are adjusted to fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill.  During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.61Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)Adoption of New Accounting StandardsEffective April 1, 2015, the Company early adopted the amended guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest, which addresses the balance sheet presentation requirements for debt issuance costs and debt discounts and premiums.  The amended guidance aligns more closely with International Financial Reporting Standards which require that transaction costs be deducted from the carrying value of the financial liability and not recorded as separate assets.  The Company reclassified $30 million of debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt in its December 31, 2014 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the current presentation.  At December 31, 2015, the long-term debt balance is net of $22 million of debt issuance costs.Effective October 1, 2015, the Company early adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which seeks to improve targeted areas of the consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures.  The amended guidance changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities.  The changes include, among others, modification of the evaluation whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities and elimination of the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s financial results.Effective October 1, 2015, the Company early adopted the amended guidance of ASC Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items, which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S.  The amended guidance aligns more closely with International Accounting Standards 1, Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1), which prohibits the presentation and disclosure of extraordinary items.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s financial results.Effective October 1, 2015, the Company early adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which seeks to resolve the diversity in practice that exists when accounting for share-based payments.  The amended guidance requires a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period to be treated as a performance condition.  The adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s financial results.Effective October 1, 2015, the Company early adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which simplifies the balance sheet presentation of deferred income taxes.  The amended guidance aligns more closely with International Accounting Standards 1, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent assets and liabilities in a classified statement of financial position.  The Company adopted the amended guidance prospectively and reclassified $185 million of current deferred tax assets in other current assets and $17 million of current deferred tax liabilities in accrued expenses and other payables to other assets and deferred income taxes, respectively, in its December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet.Pending Accounting StandardsEffective January 1, 2016, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which simplifies the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination.  The amended guidance requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date, shall be recorded in the same period’s financial statements.  The amended guidance also requires an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  The Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results.62Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)Effective January 1, 2017, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 330, Inventory, which simplifies the measurement of inventory.  The amended guidance requires an entity to measure its cost-based inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, where net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using the last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results.Effective January 1, 2018, the Company will be required to adopt the new guidance of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.  Topic 606 requires the Company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new guidance requires the Company to apply the following steps:  (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.  The Company will be required to adopt Topic 606 either on a full retrospective basis to each prior reporting period presented or on a modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application.  If the Company elects the modified retrospective approach, it will be required to provide additional disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and an explanation of the reasons for significant changes.  The Company expects to complete its assessment of the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements in 2016.Note 2.     AcquisitionsOperating results of acquisitions are included in the Company’s financial statements from the date of acquisition.Fiscal Year 2015 acquisitionsOn November 2, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent interest in Eaststarch C.V.  The acquisition includes corn wet mills in Bulgaria and Turkey and a 50 percent stake in a wet mill in Hungary enhancing the Company’s capabilities to serve customers around the world.   The 2015 post acquisition financial results of Eaststarch C.V. are reported in the Corn Processing segment.During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired four businesses, including the remaining interest in Eaststarch C.V. described above, for a total cost of $508 million.  The purchase price, net of cash acquired of $29 million, plus the acquisition-date fair values of the Company’s previously held equity interests of $385 million in Eaststarch C.V. and $64 million in North Star Shipping and Minmetal included in Others below, were preliminarily allocated as follows:63Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 2.     Acquisitions (Continued)In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized pre-tax gains of $185 million on the Eaststarch C.V. transaction and $27 million on the North Star Shipping and Minmetal transaction included in Others above, representing the difference between the carrying values and acquisition-date fair values of the Company’s previously held equity interests.  The acquisition date fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using market participant assumptions (a Level 3 measurement under applicable accounting standards).Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the Company’s acquisition of the businesses.The following table sets forth the preliminary fair values and weighted average useful lives of the other intangible assets acquired.The Company’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the post acquisition results of the acquired businesses which were immaterial.64Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 2.     Acquisitions (Continued)Fiscal Year 2014 acquisitionsOn October 1, 2014 and November 18, 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of the WILD Flavors businesses (Wild Flavors) and Specialty Commodities Inc. (SCI), respectively.  Both acquisitions are in line with the Company’s strategy to increase returns and reduce earnings volatility through the growth of its specialty ingredient offerings.  The 2014 post acquisition financial results of Wild Flavors and SCI are reported in the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment.During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company acquired six businesses, including Wild Flavors and SCI, for a total cost of $3.0 billion.  The purchase price net of cash acquired of $280 million was preliminarily allocated as follows:Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the Company’s acquisition of the businesses.  Of the $1.8 billion preliminarily allocated to goodwill, $15 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.The following table sets forth the preliminary fair values and weighted average useful lives of the other intangible assets acquired.The Company’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes the post acquisition results of Wild Flavors which were immaterial.  65Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 2.     Acquisitions (Continued)The 2015 finalization of the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of Wild Flavors resulted in an increase in goodwill of $123 million with corresponding decreases in other intangibles and other long-term liabilities.  The finalization of the purchase price allocations related to the other acquisitions did not result in material adjustments in 2015.Fiscal Year 2013 acquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company acquired four businesses for a total cost of $44 million and recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to these acquisitions.  The net cash purchase price for the acquisitions of $44 million was preliminarily allocated to working capital, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other long-term assets for $6 million, $29 million, $2 million, and $7 million, respectively.  The finalization of the purchase price allocations related to these acquisitions did not result in material adjustments.Note 3.      Fair Value MeasurementsThe following tables set forth, by level, the Company’s assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. 66Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued) Estimated fair values for inventories carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets, broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either listed or over-the-counter (OTC) markets.  Market valuations for the Company’s inventories are adjusted for location and quality because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3.  Changes in the fair value of inventories are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and option contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies.  Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1.  The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables.  Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets.  These differences are generally determined using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets.  When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3.  Except for certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense–net.  The effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur.67Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued)The Company’s cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1.The Company’s marketable securities are comprised of  equity investments, U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government agencies, and other debt securities.  Publicly traded equity investments and U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.  U.S. government agency obligations and corporate and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and substantially all are classified in Level 2.  Unrealized changes in the fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) unless a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary at which point the decline is recorded in earnings.The Company’s segregated investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities.  U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.The Company has deferred consideration under its accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) which represents a note receivable from the purchasers under the Programs.  This amount is reflected in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet (see Notes 6 and 20).  The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received.  The fair value is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.  Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the program which have historically been insignificant.The following tables present a rollforward of the activity of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.* Includes gains of $297 million that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains relating to Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2015.68Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued) * Includes losses of $328 million that are attributable to the change in unrealized losses relating to Level 3 liabilities still held at December 31, 2015. * Includes gains of $602 million that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains relating to Level 3 assets still held at December 31, 2014.69Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued)* Includes losses of $558 million that are attributable to the change in unrealized losses relating to Level 3 liabilities still held at December 31, 2014.For all periods presented, the Company had no transfers between Levels 1 and 2.   Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10% threshold.   Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2.In some cases, the price components of inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some cases, the differences are unobservable.  These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location, quality, or other contract terms.  In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as Basis.  The changes in unobservable price components are determined by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market.  Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these unobservable price components.The following table sets forth the weighted average percentage of the unobservable price components included in the Company’s Level 3 valuations as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.  The Company’s Level 3 measurements may include Basis only, transportation cost only, or both price components.  As an example, for Level 3 inventories with Basis, the unobservable component is a weighted average 10.0% of the total price for assets and 53.5% for liabilities. 70Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3.      Fair Value Measurements (Continued)In certain of the Company’s principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts.  These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price.  In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources.  In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100 percent unobservable and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3. Note 4.     Derivative Instruments & Hedging ActivitiesDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging InstrumentsThe majority of the Company’s derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments.  The Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies.  The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.  The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the value of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets.  Derivatives, including exchange traded contracts and physical purchase or sale contracts, and inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  Inventory is not a derivative and therefore fair values of and changes in fair values of inventories are not included in the tables below. The following table sets forth the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. The following table sets forth the pre-tax gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments that have been included in the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.71Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 4.     Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued)During 2014, the Company recognized $102 million of pre-tax foreign exchange hedging losses on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the Wild Flavors acquisition. Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.  Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately as a component of cost of products sold.Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedging StrategiesAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges.The Company uses interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to protect the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in interest rates.  The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying fixed-rate debt are recorded in other (income) expense - net.   The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt resulting in no ineffectiveness.    At December 31, 2015, the Company has $19 million in other current assets representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding increase in the underlying debt for the same amount with no impact to earnings. For each of the commodity hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.  Assuming normal market conditions, the changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains/losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either revenues, cost of products sold, interest expense or other (income) expense – net, as applicable.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company has $21 million of after-tax losses in AOCI related to gains and losses from commodity cash flow hedge transactions.  The Company expects to recognize $20 million of losses in its consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months.The Company uses futures or options contracts to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month.  The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s forecasted purchases of corn.  The Company’s corn processing plants currently grind approximately 76 million bushels of corn per month.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 16% and 69% of its monthly anticipated grind.  At December 31, 2015, the Company has designated hedges representing between 13% to 25% of its anticipated monthly grind of corn for the next 12 months.The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to fix the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts.  The Company has established hedging programs for ethanol sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices and to various exchange-traded ethanol contracts.  The objective of these hedging programs is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s sales of ethanol.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 6 million and 105 million gallons of ethanol sales per month under these programs.  At December 31, 2015, the Company has designated hedges representing between 0 to 13 million gallons of ethanol sales per month over the next 12 months.The following tables set forth the fair value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.72Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 4.     Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued)The following table sets forth the pre-tax gains (losses) on derivatives designated as hedging instruments that have been included in the consolidated statement of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Hedge ineffectiveness for commodity contracts results when the change in the price of the underlying commodity in a specific cash market differs from the change in the price of the derivative financial instrument used to establish the hedging relationship.  As an example, if the change in the price of a corn futures contract is strongly correlated to the change in the cash price paid for corn, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is deferred and recognized at the time the corn grind occurs.  If the change in price of the derivative does not strongly correlate to the change in the cash price of corn, in the same example, some portion or all of the derivative gains or losses may be required to be recognized in earnings prior to the corn grind occurring.Net Investment Hedging StrategiesOn June 24, 2015, the Company issued  €500 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes and €600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Notes (collectively, the “Notes”) (see Note 10 for more information about the Notes).  The Company has designated €1.1 billion of the Notes as a hedge of its net investment in a foreign subsidiary.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company has $19 million of gains in AOCI related to gains and losses from the net investment hedge transaction.  The amount is deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested.73Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 5.     Marketable SecuritiesThe following table sets forth items in short-term and long-term investments. Of the $6 million in unrealized losses at December 31, 2015, $1 million arose within the last 12 months and related to the Company’s investment in one available-for-sale equity security with a fair value of $4 million.  The market value of the Company’s investment that has been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer is $2 million and is related to the Company’s investment in one available for sale equity security.  The Company evaluated the near-term prospects of the issuer in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment.  Based on that evaluation and the Company’s ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2015.74Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 6.     Other Current AssetsThe following table sets forth the items in other current assets:(1) The Company provides financing to suppliers, primarily Brazilian farmers, to finance a portion of the suppliers’ production costs.  The amounts are reported net of allowances of $8 million and $11 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Interest earned on financing receivables of $23 million, $23 million, and $26 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings.Note 7.     Accrued Expenses and Other PayablesThe following table sets forth the items in accrued expenses and other payables: 75Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 8.     Investments in and Advances to AffiliatesThe Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in investees over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including the Company’s 19.0% and 17.3% share ownership in Wilmar as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Company had 58 and 60 unconsolidated domestic and foreign affiliates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The following table summarizes the combined balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the combined statements of earnings of the Company’s unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of its unconsolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2015, is $1.9 billion.  The Company has a direct investment in a foreign equity method investee with a carrying value of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2015, and a market value of $2.5 billion based on active market quoted prices converted to U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates at December 31, 2015.  The investment has been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months.  The Company evaluated the near-term prospects of the investee in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment.  Based on that evaluation, the Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2015.The Company provides credit facilities totaling $90 million to four unconsolidated affiliates.  Three facilities that are due on demand and bear interest between 2.67% and 3.17% have a total outstanding balance of $27 million.  The other one facility has no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015.  The outstanding balance is included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 76Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 9.     Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill balances attributable to consolidated businesses, by segment, are set forth in the following table. The changes in goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to acquisitions and purchase price allocation adjustments (see Note 2), divestitures (see Note 18), and impairments (see Note 19).The following table sets forth the other intangible assets:The change in the gross carrying amount of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily related to acquisitions as discussed in Note 2 and reclassifications between categories partially offset by purchase price allocation adjustments and foreign currency translation adjustments.Aggregate amortization expense was $75 million, $27 million, and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  The estimated future aggregate amortization expense for the next five years are $106 million, $99 million, $95 million, $93 million, and $89 million.77Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 10.     Debt Financing Arrangements (1) $700 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(2) $750 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(3) $600 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(4) $596 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(5) $420 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(6) $295 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(7) $185 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(8)   $182 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(9) $172 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(10) $187 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(11) $154 million face amount as of December 31, 2014(12) $124 million face amount as of December 31, 201478Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 10.     Debt Financing Arrangements (Continued)On June 24, 2015, the Company issued €500 million ($563 million) aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due in 2019 and €600 million ($675 million) aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Notes due in 2023.  Proceeds before expenses were €499 million ($562 million) and €594 million ($669 million) from the Floating Rate Notes and the 1.75% Notes, respectively.  At December 31, 2015, the Company designated €1.1 billion of the Notes as a hedge of its net investment in a foreign subsidiary.On July 1, 2015, the Company accepted for repurchase $794 million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding debentures (the “Debentures”) validly tendered and not withdrawn.  Pursuant to the terms of its previously announced cash tender offers, the Company paid aggregate total consideration of $961 million for the Debentures accepted for repurchase.  In September 2015, the Company redeemed $141 million of its 5.45% outstanding debentures for $156 million.  These cash tender offers and the debt redemption were financed by the Euro-denominated debt issued on June 24, 2015.  The Company recognized a debt extinguishment charge of $189 million, including transaction expenses of $7 million, in the quarter ended September 30, 2015 pertaining to these transactions.The debt issuance and the debt repurchase transactions discussed above resulted in a net increase in long-term debt of $0.3 billion.Discount amortization expense, net of premium amortization, of $8 million, $11 million, and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, were included in interest expense related to the Company’s long-term debt.At December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt exceeded the carrying value by $0.9 billion, as estimated using quoted market prices (a Level 2 measurement under applicable accounting standards).The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the five years after December 31, 2015, are $12 million, $273 million, $571 million, $552 million, and $8 million, respectively.At December 31, 2015, the Company had lines of credit totaling $5.7 billion, of which $5.6 billion was unused.  The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014, were 5.50% and 3.76%, respectively.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $4.0 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2015. The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2015.The Company has outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds at December 31, 2015 and 2014, totaling $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”).  The Programs provide the Company with up to $1.6 billion in funding resulting from the sale of accounts receivable.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company utilized $1.2 billion of its facility under the Programs (see Note 20 for more information on the Programs).Note 11.     Stock CompensationThe Company’s employee stock compensation plans provide for the granting of options to employees to purchase common stock of the Company pursuant to the Company’s 2002 and 2009 Incentive Compensation Plans.  These options are issued at market value on the date of grant, vest incrementally over one to five years, and expire ten years after the date of grant.The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model.  The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock.  The volatility of the Company’s stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Company’s stock for the period immediately prior to the date of grant corresponding to the average expected life of the grant.  The average expected life represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants.  The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model are as follows.79Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 11.     Stock Compensation (Continued)A summary of option activity during 2015 is presented below:  The weighted-average remaining contractual term of options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2015, is 6 years and 4 years, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2015, is $38 million and $47 million, respectively.  The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $10.29, $12.80, and $10.02, respectively.  The total intrinsic values of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $20 million, $66 million, and $29 million, respectively.  Cash proceeds received from options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $28 million, $93 million, and $73 million, respectively.At December 31, 2015, there was $19 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to option grants.  Amounts to be recognized as compensation expense during the next four years are $10 million, $4 million, $3 million, and $2 million, respectively.The Company’s 2002 and 2009 Incentive Compensation Plans provide for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (Restricted Stock Awards) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  In addition, the Company’s 2002 and 2009 Incentive Compensation Plans also provide for the granting of performance stock units (PSUs) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.  Restricted Stock Awards are made in common stock or stock units with equivalent rights and vest at the end of a three-year restriction period.  The awards for PSUs are made in common stock units and vest at the end of a three-year vesting period subject to the attainment of certain future performance criteria based on the Company’s adjusted return on invested capital compared to the weighted average cost of capital.  During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, 1.8 million, 1.4 million, and 0.9 million common stock or stock units, respectively, were granted as Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs.  At December 31, 2015, there were 13.8 million shares available for future grants pursuant to the 2009 plan.The fair value of Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs is determined based on the market value of the Company’s shares on the grant date.  The weighted-average grant-date fair values of awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $46.73, $40.78, and $32.96, respectively.80Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 11.     Stock Compensation (Continued)A summary of Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs activity during 2015 is presented below:At December 31, 2015, there was $59 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs.  Amounts to be recognized as compensation expense during the next three years are $36 million, $19 million, and $4 million, respectively.  The total grant-date fair value of Restricted Stock Awards that vested during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $28 million.Compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs granted to employees is generally recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of the respective grant.  Certain of the Company’s option grants, Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs continue to vest upon the recipient’s retirement from the Company and compensation expense related to option grants and Restricted Stock Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized in earnings on the date of grant.  Compensation expense for PSUs is based on the probability of meeting the performance criteria.Total compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $70 million, $55 million, and $43 million, respectively.Note 12.     Other (Income) Expense – NetThe following table sets forth the items in other (income) expense: Individually significant items included in the table above are:Gain on sale and revaluation of assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a gain of $256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, a gain of $212 million on the revaluation of the Company’s previously held equity investments in North Star Shipping, Minmetal, and Eaststarch C.V. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, and a gain of $62 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the Barcarena export terminal facility in Brazil to Glencore plc.  Gain on sale and revaluation of assets for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes a gain of $156 million upon the Company’s effective dilution in the Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company) resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units and a gain of $126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business.81Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 12.     Other (Income) Expense – Net (Continued)Loss on debt extinguishment, including transaction expenses of $7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was related to the cash tender offers and redemption of certain of the Company’s outstanding debentures.Loss on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to losses on Euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the Wild Flavors acquisition.  The loss on derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2013 was due to losses on Australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed GrainCorp Limited (GrainCorp) acquisition.Realized gains on sales of available-for-sale marketable securities totaled $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.  Realized gains on sales of available-for-sale marketable securities were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  Realized losses on sales of available-for-sale marketable securities were immaterial for all periods presented.  Impairment losses on securities of $6 million and $166 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were classified as asset impairment, exit, and restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of earnings (see Note 19 for more information).  There were no impairment losses on securities for the year ended December 31, 2015.Other - net for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes $45 million of loss provisions related to the Company’s Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities. Note 13.     Income TaxesThe following table sets forth the geographic split of earnings before income taxes:Significant components of income tax are as follows:82Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)Significant components of deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows:83Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings is as follows: The reduction from the federal statutory rate related to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulted mostly from the Company’s foreign operations in Switzerland, Asia, and the Caribbean, including significant one-time gains from portfolio actions during 2015. The Company’s foreign earnings, which were taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate and were generated from these jurisdictions, were 51%, 47%, and 65% of its foreign earnings before taxes in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.The Company had historically included amounts received from the U.S. Government in the form of a biodiesel credit as taxable income on its federal and state income tax returns.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Internal Revenue Service released a Chief Counsel Advice stipulating that biodiesel credits should not be included in taxable income.   Based upon the Chief Counsel Advice, the Company changed its position related to these credits and excluded them from income for years 2011 through the current year.  Of the total tax benefit recorded in 2013 of $107 million, $55 million relates to years prior to 2013.  The Company has $301 million and $305 million of tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards of certain international subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  As of December 31, 2015, approximately $222 million of these assets have no expiration date, and the remaining $79 million expire at various times through fiscal 2033.  The annual usage of certain of these assets is limited to a percentage of taxable income of the respective foreign subsidiary for the year. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $127 million and $218 million against these tax assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to the uncertainty of their realization.During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of a German subsidiary in the amount of $103 million ($82 million, equal to $0.12 per share, when adjusted for the income attributable to the minority interest holders).  Management’s establishment of a valuation allowance resulted from a combination of matters, including the absence of financial performance of the subsidiary and its ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future.   During 2015, the Company reversed $85 million of valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of this subsidiary following the 2014 Wild Flavors acquisition and the subsequent restructuring of the consolidated tax group where this subsidiary belongs.During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company placed a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to the impairment of its investment in GrainCorp in the amount of $41 million.  The Company also placed a full valuation allowance on the impairment of assets related to its sugar business in Brazil in the amount of $17 million.  During 2015, the Company recorded an additional impairment of assets and other provisions related to the sugar business increasing the valuation allowance to $58 million.84Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)The Company has $22 million and $21 million of tax assets related to foreign and domestic capital loss carryforwards at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $22 million and $21 million against these tax assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.The Company has $90 million and $76 million of tax assets related to excess foreign tax credits at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which begin to expire in 2016.  Due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $8 million against these assets at December 31, 2015.  The Company has $62 million and $70 million of tax assets related to state income tax attributes (incentive credits and net operating loss carryforwards), net of federal tax benefit, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which will expire at various times through fiscal 2035.  Due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $47 million and $51 million related to state income tax assets net of federal tax benefit as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Company remains subject to federal examination in the U.S. for the calendar tax years 2014 and 2015.Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and the Company’s share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method aggregating to approximately $9.6 billion at December 31, 2015, are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes has been provided thereon.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these undistributed earnings.The following table sets forth a rollforward of activity of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as follows: The additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table include effects related to net income and shareholders’ equity.  The changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Company’s net income or cash flow.At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $20 million and $21 million, respectively.The Company is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world.  Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete.  Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions.  However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.  Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate in any given period.  If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time, there would be a reduction of $36 million on the tax expense for that period.85Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 13.     Income Taxes (Continued)The Company is subject to routine examination by domestic and foreign tax authorities and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiation with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions. In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential additional tax owed by the Company in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.  However, the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations.The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ADM do Brasil Ltda. (ADM do Brasil), has received three separate tax assessments from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (BFRS) challenging the tax deductibility of commodity hedging losses and related expenses for the tax years 2004, 2006 and 2007.  As of December 31, 2015, these assessments, updated for estimated penalties, interest, and variation in currency exchange rates, totaled approximately $361 million.  ADM do Brasil’s tax return for 2005 was also audited and no assessment was received.  The statute of limitations for 2005 and 2008 to 2010 has expired.  The Company does not expect to receive any additional tax assessments. ADM do Brasil enters into commodity hedging transactions that can result in gains, which are included in ADM do Brasil’s calculation of taxable income in Brazil, and losses, which ADM do Brasil deducts from its taxable income in Brazil.  The Company has evaluated its tax position regarding these hedging transactions and concluded, based upon advice from Brazilian legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize both gains and losses resulting from hedging transactions when determining its Brazilian income tax expense.  Therefore, the Company has continued to recognize the tax benefit from hedging losses in its financial statements and has not recorded any tax liability for the amounts assessed by the BFRS.ADM do Brasil filed an administrative appeal for each of the assessments.  The appeal panel found in favor of the BFRS on these assessments and ADM do Brasil filed a second level administrative appeal.  The second administrative appeal panel continues to conduct customary procedural activities, including ongoing dialogue with the BFRS auditor.  If ADM do Brasil continues to be unsuccessful in the administrative appellate process, the Company intends to file appeals in the Brazilian federal courts.  While the Company believes its consolidated financial statements properly reflect the tax deductibility of these hedging losses, the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in the future recognition of additional payments of, and expense for, income tax and the associated interest and penalties.  The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2010.The Company’s subsidiaries in Argentina have received tax assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports totaling $123 million (inclusive of interest and adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates) for the tax years 2004 through 2008.  The Argentine tax authorities have been conducting a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion.  While the Company believes that it has complied with all Argentine tax laws, it cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for years subsequent to 2008, and estimates that these potential assessments would be approximately $165 million (as of December 31, 2015 and subject to variation in currency exchange rates).   The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments, and has concluded, based on Argentine tax law, that its tax position would be sustained, and accordingly, has not recorded a tax liability for these assessments.  The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2008.In accordance with the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions, the Company has not recorded an uncertain tax liability for these assessments because it has concluded that it is more likely than not to prevail on the Brazil and Argentina matters based upon their technical merits and because the taxing jurisdictions’ processes do not provide a mechanism for settling at less than the full amount of the assessment.  The Company’s consideration of these tax assessments requires judgments about the application of income tax regulations to specific facts and circumstances.  The final outcome of these matters cannot reliably be predicted, may take many years to resolve, and could result in financial impacts of up to the entire amount of these assessments.  86Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 14.     LeasesThe Company leases manufacturing and warehouse facilities, real estate, transportation assets, and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, the majority of which expire at various dates through the year 2024. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $241 million, $224 million, and $199 million, respectively.  Additional amounts incurred for charges pertaining to time charters of ocean going vessels accounted for as leases for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $110 million, $136 million, and $147 million, respectively.  Future minimum rental payments for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows: 87Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 15.     Employee Benefit PlansThe Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain foreign subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  The Company provides eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are “grandfathered” into subsidized coverage while others are provided with Health Care Reimbursement Accounts as described below).The Company maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. employees.  The Company contributes cash to the plans to match qualifying employee contributions, and also provides a non-matching employer contribution of 1% of pay to eligible participants.  Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in ADM stock as part of their own investment elections.  The employer contributions are expensed when paid.  Assets of the Company’s 401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds.  The Company’s 401(k) plans held 12 million shares of Company common stock at December 31, 2015, with a market value of $426 million.  Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock by these plans during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $13 million. 88Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)The following tables set forth changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of defined benefit plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Included in accumulated other comprehensive income for pension benefits at December 31, 2015, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service cost of $4 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $851 million.  The prior service cost and actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during 2016 is $2 million and $56 million, respectively.89Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)Included in accumulated other comprehensive income for postretirement benefits at December 31, 2015, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost: unrecognized prior service credit of $68 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $41 million.  Prior service credit of $17 million and actuarial loss of $3 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during 2016.The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing net periodic pension cost: The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing the year-end actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations: The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $2.5 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively as of December 31, 2015, and $2.9 billion, $2.6 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.  The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $2.5 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2015 and $2.8 billion, $2.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.  The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively.For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 7.25% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% by 2025 and remain at that level thereafter.  The credits used to fund certain retirees with Health Reimbursement Accounts are indexed up to a maximum of 2% per year.A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: 90Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)Plan AssetsThe Company’s employee benefit plan assets are principally comprised of the following types of investments:Common stock:Equity securities are valued based on quoted exchange prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.Mutual funds:Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.Common collective trust (CCT) funds:The fair values of the CCTs are based on the cumulative net asset value (NAV) of their underlying investments. The investments in CCTs are comprised of international equity funds, a small cap U.S. equity fund, large cap U.S. equity funds, fixed income funds, and other funds.  The fund units are valued at NAV based on the closing market value of the units bought or sold as of the valuation date and are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The CCTs seek primarily to provide investment results approximating the aggregate price, dividend performance, total return, and income stream of underlying investments of the funds.  Issuances and redemptions of certain of the CCT investments may be restricted by date and/or amount.Corporate debt instruments:Corporate debt instruments are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.U.S.  Treasury instruments:U.S. Treasury instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.U.S. government agency, state, and local government bonds:U.S. government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants’ methods, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.91Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.92Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)Level 3 Gains and Losses:There are no Plan assets classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy; therefore there are no gains or losses associated with Level 3 assets.93Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)The following table sets forth the actual asset allocation for the Company’s global pension plan assets as of the measurement date: Investment objectives for the Company’s plan assets are to:Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.  Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes.  The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically.Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.  These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where applicable.  In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments.The Company uses external consultants to assist in monitoring the investment strategy and asset mix for the Company’s plan assets.  To develop the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies.  Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets.Contributions and Expected Future Benefit PaymentsBased on actuarial calculations, the Company expects to contribute $31 million to the pension plans and $13 million to the postretirement benefit plan during 2016.  The Company may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during this period.94Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15.     Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid by the benefit plans: Note 16.     Shareholders’ EquityThe Company has authorized one billion shares of common stock and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, each with zero par value.  No preferred stock has been issued.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had approximately 120.8 million shares and 79.4 million shares, respectively, of its common shares in treasury.  Treasury stock of $4.7 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is recorded at cost as a reduction of common stock.Included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI is a $19 million net of tax income pertaining to foreign currency-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge (see Note 4 for more information).The following tables set forth the changes in AOCI by component and the reclassifications out of AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: 95Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16.     Shareholders’ Equity (Continued)The change in foreign currency translation adjustment is primarily due to the U.S. dollar appreciation, mainly impacting the Euro-denominated equity of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.The foreign currency translation adjustment reclassified to earnings in 2015 is due to foreign currency translation loss recognized upon the acquisition of the remaining interest in Eaststarch C.V. partially offset by foreign currency translation gain recognized upon the sale of the global cocoa and chocolate businesses.96Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 17.     Segment and Geographic InformationThe Company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  The Company’s operations are organized, managed and classified into four reportable business segments:  Agricultural Services, Corn Processing, Oilseeds Processing, and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other.Effective January 1, 2015, the Company formed a fourth reportable business segment, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients.  Results of Wild Flavors and SCI, which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, are reported in this segment in addition to results of certain product lines previously reported in the Agricultural Services, Corn Processing, and Oilseeds Processing business segments.  Prior period results of the product lines previously reported in the other reportable business segments have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.The Agricultural Services segment utilizes its extensive global grain elevator and transportation networks, and port operations to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.  The Agricultural Services segment includes international agricultural commodities merchandising and handling activities managed through a global trade desk based in Rolle, Switzerland.  Agricultural Services’ grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations.  Agricultural Services’ transportation network capabilities include barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, and rail freight services.  The Agricultural Services segment also includes the activities related to structured trade finance and the processing of wheat into wheat flour.   In May 2015, the Company acquired the remaining interests in North Star Shipping and Minmetal which operate export facilities at the Romanian Port of Constanta on the Black Sea.  The Agricultural Services segment also includes the Company’s 32.2% share of the results of its Pacificor (formerly Kalama Export Company LLC) joint venture and returns associated with the Company’s 19.8% investment in GrainCorp.The Company’s Corn Processing segment is engaged in corn wet milling and dry milling activities, utilizing its asset base primarily located in the central part of the United States with additional facilities in China, Bulgaria, and Turkey.  The Corn Processing segment converts corn into sweeteners, starches, and bioproducts.  Its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose, and dextrose.  Dextrose and starch are used by the Corn Processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations.  By fermentation of dextrose, the Corn Processing segment produces alcohol, amino acids, and other food and animal feed ingredients.  Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company for industrial use as ethanol or as beverage grade.  Ethanol, in gasoline, increases octane and is used as an extender and oxygenate.  Bioproducts also include essential amino acids such as lysine and threonine used in swine and poultry diets to optimize performance.  Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers’ grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients.  Corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal.  The Corn Processing segment also includes activities related to the processing and distribution of formula feeds and animal health and nutrition products.  Other Corn Processing products include citric acids and glycols, all of which are used in various food and industrial products.  The Corn Processing segment also includes the activities of  the Company’s Brazilian sugarcane ethanol plant and related operations.  This segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investments in Almidones Mexicanos S.A., and Red Star Yeast Company LLC.  In May 2015, the Company sold its lactic acid business.  In November 2015, the Company completed the purchase of the remaining interest in Eaststarch C.V.97Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 17.     Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)The Oilseeds Processing segment includes global activities related to the origination, merchandising, crushing, and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals.  Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the Company include ingredients for the food, feed, energy, and industrial products industries.  Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  Oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  In Europe and South America, the Oilseeds Processing segment includes origination and merchandising activities as adjuncts to its oilseeds processing assets.  These activities include a network of grain elevators, port facilities, and transportation assets used to buy, store, clean, and transport grains and oilseeds.  The Oilseeds Processing segment is a major supplier of peanuts, tree nuts, and peanut-derived ingredients to both the U.S. and export markets.  In North America, cottonseed flour is produced and sold primarily to the pharmaceutical industry and cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and filter markets.  The Oilseeds Processing segment also included activities related to its global chocolate and cocoa businesses until the sale of these businesses in July 2015 and October 2015, respectively.  The Oilseeds Processing segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited (Wilmar) and its share of results for its Stratas Foods LLC and Edible Oils Limited joint ventures.  In 2015, the Company acquired additional shares in Wilmar increasing its ownership interest from 17.3% to 19.0%.  In September 2015, the Company completed the purchase of Belgian oil bottler, AOR N.V. The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment engages in the manufacturing, sales, and distribution of specialty products including natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products, and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment also includes the activities related to the procurement, processing, and distribution of edible beans.  The Company’s Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment includes the activities of Wild Flavors and SCI, which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and Eatem Foods, a leading developer and producer of premium traditional, natural, and organic savory flavor systems, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Other includes the Company’s remaining operations, primarily its financial business units, related to futures commission and insurance activities.

Certain Corporate items are not allocated to the Company’s reportable business segments.  Corporate results principally include the impact of LIFO-related adjustments, unallocated corporate expenses, interest cost net of investment income, and the Company’s share of the results of an equity investment.98Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 17.     Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)Segment Information99Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 17.     Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)100Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 17.     Segment and Geographic Information (Continued) 101Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 17.     Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)Geographic information:  The following geographic data include revenues attributed to the countries based on the location of the subsidiary making the sale and long-lived assets based on physical location.  Long-lived assets represent the net book value of property, plant, and equipment.  102Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 18.     Assets and Liabilities Held for SaleOn July 31, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its global chocolate business to Cargill, Inc. for $431 million and recorded a gain on sale of $38 million, net of transaction expenses, in the Oilseeds Processing segment in the year ended December 31, 2015.  Prior to July 31, 2015, assets and liabilities of the global chocolate business subject to the purchase and sale agreement were classified as held for sale in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.On October 16, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its global cocoa business to Olam International Limited for $1.2 billion and recorded a gain on sale of $206 million, net of transaction expenses, in the Oilseeds Processing segment in the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  Prior to October 16, 2015, assets and liabilities of the global cocoa business subject to the purchase and sale agreement have been classified as held for sale in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.The global chocolate and cocoa businesses do not comprise a major component of the Company’s operations and therefore do not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations at December 31, 2015 and 2014 under the amended guidance of ASC Topics 205 and 360 which the Company early adopted on October 1, 2014.  Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell.  As of December 31, 2014, the carrying value of the cocoa and chocolate assets were less than fair value less costs to sell, and accordingly, no adjustment to the asset value was necessary.There were no assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2015.The major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2014 were as follows:103Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 19.     Asset Impairment, Exit, and Restructuring CostsThe following table sets forth the charges included in asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs.   Note 20.     Sale of Accounts ReceivableSince March 2012, the Company has had an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Program”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Purchasers”).  Under the Program, certain U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Receivables, LLC (“ADM Receivables”).  ADM Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.  In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $1.3 billion, as amended, and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Program terminates on June 24, 2016, unless extended.104Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 20.     Sale of Accounts Receivable (Continued)In March 2014, the Company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program (the “Second Program”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Second Purchasers”).  Under the Second Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland Receivables Company (“ADM Ireland Receivables”).  ADM Ireland Receivables in turn transfers such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Second Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.    In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $0.3 billion and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  The Second Program terminates on March 18, 2016, unless extended.  Under the Program and Second Program (collectively, the “Programs”), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the Purchasers and Second Purchasers and other consideration to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables.The Company accounts for these transfers as sales.  The Company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and its right to the deferred consideration.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions and its cost of servicing the receivables sold. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet was $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.  In exchange for the transfer as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company received cash of $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion and recorded a receivable for deferred consideration included in other current assets $513 million and $511 million, respectively.  Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were $40.7 billion, $36.4 billion, and $39.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  Of this amount, $40.3 billion, $35.1 billion, and $39.8 billion pertain to cash collections on the deferred consideration for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  Deferred consideration is paid to the Company in cash on behalf of the Purchasers as receivables are collected; however, as this is a revolving facility, cash collected from the Company’s customers is reinvested by the Purchasers daily in new receivable purchases under the Program.The Company’s risk of loss following the transfer of accounts receivable under the Program is limited to the deferred consideration outstanding.  The Company carries the deferred consideration at fair value determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received and is principally based on observable inputs (a Level 2 measurement under the applicable accounting standards) consisting mainly of the face amount of the receivables adjusted for anticipated credit losses and discounted at the appropriate market rate.  Payment of deferred consideration is not subject to significant risks other than delinquencies and credit losses on accounts receivable transferred under the program which have historically been insignificant.Transfers of receivables under the Program during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of $5 million, $5 million, and $4 million, respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.The Company reflects all cash flows related to the Program as operating activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Company’s trade receivables.105Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 21.     Legal Proceedings, Guarantees, and CommitmentsThe Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for information on income tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution with the applicable government authorities.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.  On April 22, 2011, certain manufacturers and distributors of sugar cane and beet sugar products filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against the Company, other manufacturers and marketers of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and the Corn Refiners Association, alleging that the defendants falsely claimed that HFCS is “natural” and nutritionally equivalent to sugar.  Defendants vigorously denied the plaintiffs’ allegations and filed a counterclaim.  Trial began on November 3, 2015, and on November 20, 2015, the parties announced that they had reached a confidential settlement in which all parties dropped their claims.  The Company is a party to numerous lawsuits pending in various U.S. state and federal courts arising out of Syngenta Corporation’s (Syngenta) marketing and distribution of genetically modified corn products, Agrisure Viptera and Agrisure Duracade, in the U.S.  First, the Company brought a state court action in Louisiana against Syngenta in 2014, alleging that Syngenta was negligent in commercializing its products before the products were approved in certain non-U.S. markets.  Second, the Company is a putative class member in a number of purported class actions filed beginning in 2013 by farmers and other parties against Syngenta in federal courts and consolidated for pretrial proceedings in a multidistrict litigation proceeding in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, again alleging that Syngenta was negligent in commercializing its products.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, Syngenta has in turn filed third-party claims against the Company and other grain companies seeking contribution in the event that Syngenta is held liable in these lawsuits.  Third, the Company has been named as a defendant in approximately 130 suits filed by farmers and other parties beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, alleging that the Company and other grain companies were negligent in failing to screen for genetically modified corn.  The Company denies liability in all of the actions in which it has been named as a third-party defendant or defendant.  All of these actions are in pretrial proceedings, and it is premature at this time to estimate a range of potential liability.The Company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the Company to make future payments if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligations.  The Company has not recorded a liability for payment of these contingent obligations, as the Company believes the fair value of these contingent obligations is immaterial.  The Company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.  These contingent obligations totaled $4 million at December 31, 2015.106Archer-Daniels-Midland CompanyNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)Note 22.     Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) Net earnings attributable to controlling interests for the second quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 include after-tax gains totaling $71 million (equal to $0.11 per share) related to the revaluation of the Company’s previously held investments in North Star Shipping and Minmetal in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, the sale of a 50% interest in the Barcarena export terminal facility in Brazil to Glencore plc, and sale of the lactic business as discussed in Note 12, and long-lived asset and goodwill impairments, and restructuring charges related primarily to certain international Oilseeds Processing facilities of $28 million after tax (equal to $0.04 per share) as discussed in Note 19.

The acquisition expands the Company’s global sweeteners and starches footprint. Both transactions are expected to close in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals.108Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and ShareholdersArcher-Daniels-Midland CompanyChicago, IllinoisWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), and our report dated February 19, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSt. Louis, MissouriFebruary 19, 2016 109Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and ShareholdersArcher-Daniels-Midland CompanyChicago, IllinoisWe have audited Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, and our report dated February 19, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSt. Louis, MissouriFebruary 19, 2016110None.As of December 31, 2015, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)).  Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGArcher-Daniels-Midland Company’s (ADM’s) management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  ADM’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, ADM’s management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
